# dokanadmin

- Run `npm install` and then `expo start`
- Download [expo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) from play store and scan the qr code.

## Features

- Order Details include WooCommerce Extra Product Options (text fields only) from [Theme Complete Plugin](https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-extra-product-options/7908619)
